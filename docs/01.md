## Review of R basics

**R** is the name of the programming language. **RStudio** is the name of the integrated development
environment (IDE). The program you should be running is **RStudio**.

If you do not already have these, **R** can be downloaded [here](https://utstat.toronto.edu/cran/). 
**RStudio** (desktop version) can be downloaded 
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop).


### Configure RStudio settings

The settings can be found under `Tools -> Global Options...`.

Uncheck all boxes and modify all dropdowns that mention saving items upon exit and restoring items
upon startup. This will ensure that RStudio starts with a fresh session each time.


### Console pane

When RStudio application is opened, the **Console** pane should occupy the entirety of the left side.
*(Open the below image in a new tab if it is too small)*

Any code that is typed into the **Console** is evaluated immediately upon pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

words <- c("apple", "orange", "banana")
```

## Review of R basics

**R** is the name of the programming language. **RStudio** is the name of the integrated development
environment (IDE). The application you should be running is **RStudio**.

If you do not already have these, **R** can be downloaded [here](https://utstat.toronto.edu/cran/). 
**RStudio** (desktop version) can be downloaded 
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop). **R** should be installed before
installing **RStudio**. 

If you already have **R** installed on your device, ensure that the version is >= 4.0.0. Otherwise,
use the links above to install the latest version.


### Configure RStudio settings

The settings can be found under `Tools -> Global Options...`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/settings-general.png")
```

Uncheck all boxes and modify all dropdowns that mention saving items upon exit and restoring items
upon startup. This will ensure that RStudio starts with a fresh session each time.


### Console pane

When the RStudio application is opened, the **Console** pane should occupy the entirety of the left
side. *(Open the below image in a new tab if it is too small)*

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/rstudio-console.png")
```

Any code that is typed into the **Console** is evaluated immediately upon pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
If you need to evaluate multi-line code, <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> should be used to
create line breaks.


### Source pane

When the RStudio application is opened, the **Source** pane is hidden by default. The **Source**
pane is where you modify your R scripts. It is strongly recommended that you save all your important
code (code that you may need to revisit at a later date) inside a R script file. A new R script can
be created using:

-   `File -> New File -> R Script`, or
-   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>, or
-   Clicking <img src="./img/new-file.png"> and selecting "R Script"

The **Source** pane will appear in the top left when there is an open R script. 
*(Open the below image in a new tab if it is too small)*

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/rstudio-source.png")
```

Code that is typed in a script file is not evaluated upon pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Code must be
sent from the **Source** to the **Console** for evaluation.

-   To run a single line of code, place the typing cursor anywhere on the line and press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
-   To run multiple lines of code, highlight the desired lines and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
-   To run an entire script from start to finish, click <img src="./img/source-button.png"> .


### Environment pane

The **Environment** pane is the top right pane of RStudio. This pane shows all variables that have
been initialised in your current R session. All variables in the current R session can be removed
by clicking the broom icon. Alternatively, switching from *Grid* view to *List* view will allow you
remove only selected variables.


### Comments

Comments can be added to an R script by prepending them with a `#` symbol.


### Variables

Variables are created using the convention `name <- value`.

```{r}
var1 <- 3
```

Once a variable has been successfully initialised, it should appear in the **Environment** pane. For
simple variables, the value of the variable can be seen in the **Environment** pane. For variables
whose values are not visible in the **Environment** pane, their values can be checked by calling
them in the **Console**:

```{r}
var1
```

or by using RStudio's built-in viewer by typing in the **Console**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(var1)
```


### Vectors

Vectors are univariate data structures. Vectors can be created using the `c()` function with 
elements separated by commas.

```{r}
nums <- c(9, 12, 20)
words <- c("apple", "orange", "banana")
```

Note that in the example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
var1 <- 3
```

`var1` is actually a vector of length 1.

When calling vectors in the **Console**, note that the numbers in the square brackets of the 
corresponding output represent the position number of the first element of the line.

```{r}
var2 <- 1:30

var2
```

The elements of vectors can be extracted by supplying a vector of positive integers inside square 
brackets. **Note that in R, indices begin at 1.**

```{r}
var2[7]
var2[c(2, 7, 9, 11, 20)]
```

The elements of vectors can be deleted by supplying a vector of negative integers inside square
brackets. **Note that in R, indices begin at 1.**

```{r}
var2[-7]
var2[c(-2, -7, -9, -11, -20)]
var2[-c(2, 7, 9, 11, 20)]
```


### Data frames

Data frames are multivariate data structures. Data frames can be thought of as a vertical
concatentation of vectors. In most cases, each column of a data frame contains the values for a 
single variable and each row of a data frame contains the values of each variable for a single 
observation. For example, consider the following data set:

```{r}
patients <- data.frame(
  patient_id = c("123abc", "28fnr8", "02jr8d", "r82j45", "t90ro5"),
  height = c(181, 145, 190, 210, 94),
  mass = c(85, 72, 82, 90, 60),
  sex = c("M", "F", "M", "F", "F")
)

patients
```

In the example above, each column contains the values for a single variable and each row contains
the values of each variable for a single observation (patient). 

Things to note:

-   Data frames can be created by supplying name-value pairs to the `data.frame()` function.
-   Name-value pairs are supplied using `=` rather than `<-`.
-   Each name-value pair must have the same length. Missing values can be represented using `NA`.
